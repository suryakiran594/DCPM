Dynamic Contention Pricing for future Air Space
Dynamic Pricing Contention for Future Airspace
This project implements a dynamic pricing contention system for future airspace, utilizing reinforcement learning techniques for scheduling and collision avoidance strategies. The system aims to efficiently allocate airspace access to multiple users (UAVs) based on their bidding priorities and budgets while ensuring safety and fairness.
